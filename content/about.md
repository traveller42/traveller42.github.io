# About the Traveller
I'm Clark B. Wierda.  I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.

## Codesmith
Computer Programming and Data Communications have been my primary work subjects.

## Travel
I live up to the name.  I've been to many countries on most of the continents.  (I'm still working on Antarctica.)

# About This Blog
The primary purpose of this blog is to collect things that I learn to help set
the knowledge in my mind.  Another purpose is to have content to use to learn about
Hugo and the other tools used to create the content, generate the pages, and deploy
the updates.
