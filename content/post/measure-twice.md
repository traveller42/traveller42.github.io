## Measure Twice; ~~Cut~~ Order Once

While assembling my portable supercomputer, I discovered that the cables I
had ordered were too short.  I had neglected to allow for the strain-reliefs
at each end and the need to not stress the sockets these cables are plugged
into.  I should have used the longer cables I have to determine the length I
needed before ordering all the cables for the project.
